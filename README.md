Welcome! If you are reading this for the first time - Awesome, you have come to the right place to learn about The Comet Coders.

Who we are is a group of motivated people in various stages of life. We meet routinely to talk about craft, challenges and knowledge - and in doing so keeping each other accountable.

Anyone can become a Comet Coder so long as you abide by The Comet Coder's Code of Conduct. Please take a moment to read them. 

Code of Conduct
- Be Nice. Thankfully, our group has only had awesome, positive and resilient people.
- Show up. At least once every 2 months to a meeting. Life is full of ups and downs, lows and highs - this rule isn't intended to enforce attendance like an elementary school teacher but what it is intended for is ensuring the community is active and our Discord channels are clean.
- Bring something. Anything code related in some shape or form - something you learned, a code snippet, current news, UIUX, Backend, Frontend, Linux, AWS, CI/CD and so much more.

And that's it for now, i'll leave you with a quote


“My dear, here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that.”
